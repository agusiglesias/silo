                In the wake of this unending colonial earthquake, six Samoan characters make their lives between two cultures: playing, gossiping, enduring, enforcing the patriarchal status quo and carving out powerful new identities.

                <p class="info-txt">Tight passes. Soft touches. Hustle out there and mark your man. Every Saturday, nine teenage girls come together to train and play soccer. They’re high achievers and burnouts, insiders and outsiders, best friends and vicious bullies and – often – all of the above, all at once.
                <br>
                <br>
                Bristling with confidence and ferocious energy, Sarah DeLappe’s barnstorming, Pulitzer Prize-nominated debut is a frank and hilarious portrait of nine young warriors – messy, mean and full of compassion – working out who they are and the battles they’ll have to fight.

                <p class="info-txt">Silo’s 2014 sell-out hit returns for a new year and a new you. Five years on, serial dater Anna’s back on the market and looking for love in all the wrong places. Each night, she meets a new blind date, each one played by a different performer, each one a surprise to Anna.
                <br>
                <br>
                Unscripted and unrehearsed, relying solely on impulse, a shot of tequila and their phones, Anna and her date are directed via live texts and calls as they put their hearts on the line and their nerves to the ultimate test.
                <br>
                <br>
                Natalie Medlock reprises her star turn as Anna in this fully improvised theatrical experiment about love, fear and some really questionable karaoke. Created by Sydney’s Ride On Theatre and performed around the world with guest actors like Margot Robbie, Laverne Cox and Jason Alexander, The Blind Date Project is awkward, unpredictable and wildly entertaining.
                <br>
                <br>
                Locket, the pop-up bar in Q Theatre in which The Blind Date Project takes place, will be open post-show Fridays and Saturdays, demand permitting. Drinks, karaoke and plenty of seating are available at Locket.</p>

                <p class="info-txt">Welcome to the City of Dreams: Bombay, the height of the 1970s. Legendary Bollywood director Rakesh Ramsey has died in the middle of shooting his latest film, Dust of the Delhi Plains, an epic desi western with all the trappings: magnificent landscapes, gunfights on horseback, saloon bars and bounty-hunters.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ramsey’s two children, Roshan and Kamala, are forced into the director’s chair. But they’ve inherited a disaster: the crew’s unhappy, the money’s all gone and the big Bollywood star is holding the production hostage. Can Roshan and Kamala bring their father’s dying dream to the big screen, or is Dust of the Delhi Plains as cursed as everyone says?
                <br>
                <br>
                Created by visionary theatre-maker Ahi Karunaharan (A Fine Balance, Tea, Swabhoomi: Borrowed Earth), My Heart Goes Thadak Thadak is a joyous and immersive night at the theatre filled with sibling showdowns, divas, dancing and pure movie-making magic. </p>
